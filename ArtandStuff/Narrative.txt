   * Show off your best side and you’ll be golden.
   * Why even try? It’s not like you’re going to get it. 
* I’ve narrowed down the job search, just gotta pick one. Any ideas?
   * Go for what best fits your personality. Loving your work is more important than money.
   * Whatever pays most.
   * You won’t have a chance, so what’s it matter?
Pentagon
* I’ve tried every trick in the book, but no job around here is hiring.

* Got plenty of quality watches, at prices that are a steal.
   * You need to be careful. Selling stolen watches can only lead to trouble.

   * I’ve been there, it’ll probably pass.
   * At this point you might want to just give up.
* Infidelity isn’t that bad, is it?
   * Breaking that bond of trust can ruin a relationship forever. Be honest and true.

   * Free things never hurt.
Triangle

   * I’ll call the police.
   * Better get running.
   * That sucks.
