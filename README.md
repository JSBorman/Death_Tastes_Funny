## Gameplay Questions
 - How do you die?
 - How are characters different?
 - Is more than one character visible at a time?
   - If so; what does the 'ex'-character do while you control the new one?
   - If so; how do you interact with other characters?
   - If not; what did your previous play through change?
 - After a character has died, can you play as them again?
 - What are you trying to accomplish?


## Mechanics based off The Egg
 - To 'finish' the game, you must play through as each available character
 - There is more than one character & every character is playable
   - However, the player *may* not have control over the order
 - When the player dies, it is not the end of the game; they continue playing as another character


## Some Gameplay Options
### Progression through Puzzles
   - Playing through the level as each seperate character can 'unlock' the next area (like Thomas was Alone, except with a lot more death)

   - Playing w/ Perspective? Different characters can see different portions of a map/image (like Fez, if each character had a different side of the cube) 

   - Key Question for the genre: Can the player reselect a character who has died?

### Platformer
   - Actions previously performed can assist in next round of play
   -- i.e you get two(?) past lives to work with at any time, effectively forming extra platforms
   - Swap out characters like thomas was alone, but triggered on death instead
   - Each level is like a stage in a dream
   --- Falling from a platform means you have to walk back to the start of the level/checkpoint (doesn't kill you)
   --- End of the level, you wake up from the dream into a new area
   --- Note: potentially art heavy
   
### Misc
   - You play as someone who manages a funeral home
